Chapter 1 : Reliable, Scalable and Maintainable Applications

- Biggest Problem : Data
- Break System into Small tasks, use tools, Stitch with application code
- Reliability
	- Faults and Failures
	- Fault tolerant and Resilient
	- Types
		- H/w
		- S/w : Avoid By
			- Testing
			- Process Isolation
			- Process to crash and restart : ex Chaos Monkey
			- Measuring
			- Monitoring
			- Analysing in Prod
		- Human Errors
- Scalability
	- Load Params
		- RPS
		- Read:Write in DB
		- Active Users in Chat Room
		- Hit Rate in Cache
	- Track performance on Load increase
		- Response Time
		- Latency
		- Tail Latencies
- Maintainability
	- Operability 
		- Health Monitoring
		- Documentation
		- S/w Up to date
		- Security
	- Simplicity
		- Good Abstractions
		- Accidental complexity
	- Evolvability
		- Easier to modify
-Non Functinal requirements of a system
	- Scalability
	- Availability
	- Consistency
	- Reliability
	- Durability
	- Security
	- Compliance
	- Compatibitly
	- Maintainibility
